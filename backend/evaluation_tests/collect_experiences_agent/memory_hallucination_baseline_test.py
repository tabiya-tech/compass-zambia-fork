"""
Baseline evaluation test for memory recall accuracy after conversation summarization.

PURPOSE:
    Verify (and measure) whether the chatbot hallucinates or blends experience details
    when recalling a specific past experience after the conversation history has been
    compressed by the summarizer.

BACKGROUND:
    The ConversationMemoryManager uses a sliding window:
      - UNSUMMARIZED_WINDOW_SIZE = 10 (turns kept verbatim)
      - TO_BE_SUMMARIZED_WINDOW_SIZE = 3 (turns staged before compression)
    Summarization first fires at turn 13, then every 3 turns after that.

    The summarizer uses gemini-2.5-flash-lite with HIGH_TEMPERATURE and a 100-word cap,
    instructed to "capture essence not details" — meaning specific experience details
    are at high risk of being dropped or blended after compression.

WHAT THIS TEST MEASURES:
    Two experiences are collected in the first 12 turns:
      1. PAID: Data Entry Clerk at a telecom company (entering data, filing forms)
      2. VOLUNTEERING: Survey Enumerator at an NGO (asking questions, recording answers,
         convincing hesitant respondents)

    After summarization fires, filler turns push early experience details out of the
    verbatim window. Then the user asks a direct recall question:
        "Can you remind me what I said I volunteered for?"

    The test scores whether the agent recalls the correct (volunteering) details
    without hallucinating or blending in the paid (data entry/telecom) details.

PASS CRITERIA:
    Score >= 60/100 across 5 repeated runs signals acceptable recall.
    Score < 60 on 3+ of 5 runs confirms the hallucination bug at 60-80% frequency.

    Measures hallucination rate when recalling a specific past experience after
    conversation summarization has fired.

    This test uses a reduced window size (unsummarized=2, to_be_summarized=3) so that
    summarization fires at turn 5 and again at turn 8, compressing the paid experience
    details well before the recall probe at turn 12.

    Conversation is designed to:
      - Collect a PAID experience (Data Entry Clerk, telecom, entering data/filing) in turns 1-6
        → summarization fires at turns 5 and 8, compressing these details into <=100 words
      - Collect a VOLUNTEERING experience (Survey Enumerator, NGO, asking questions/recording
        answers/convincing respondents) in turns 7-11
      - Ask the recall probe at turn 12 (mid-conversation, before agent finishes):
          "wait, before we continue — can you remind me what I said I volunteered for"

    The MEMORY_RECALL_ACCURACY evaluator scores whether the agent's recall response:
      - Correctly describes the Survey Enumerator / NGO role (score 86-100)
      - Partially blends in paid experience details (score 31-60)
      - Fully hallucinates or describes the wrong experience (score 0-30)

    A pass threshold of 60 is set. If the test fails on 3+ of 5 runs, this confirms
    the hallucination bug at ~60-80% frequency and justifies the memory architecture fix.
