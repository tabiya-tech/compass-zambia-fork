                     Duties: entering customer data into systems, filing forms, organizing records.
                  2. A VOLUNTEERING experience: Survey Enumerator at an NGO.
                     Duties: asking questions to respondents, recording answers, occasionally
                     convincing hesitant respondents to participate.

                After summarization has occurred, the user asks the EVALUATED_AGENT to recall
                what they said they volunteered for.

                A CORRECT response:
                  - Describes the Survey Enumerator / NGO volunteering role accurately
                  - Does NOT mention telecom, data entry, filing forms, or customer records

                5. Assign a score from 0 to 100:
